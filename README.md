# Readme

This repository is used for example material and presentation material
that I (and now others, I guess) can use for discussing, demonstrating
or teaching .NET development.

Please note, I am human and make errors or omissions so if you use this in anyway, that decision to use was yours and yours alone.  Don't get cranky
work around it, fork the project and raise a pull-request or raise an issue...
it's GitHub!
