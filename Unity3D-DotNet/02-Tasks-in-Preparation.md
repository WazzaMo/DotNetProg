# Preparation

## Establish a Development Environment
### Get Unity Personal Edition - a free download for Mac, Windows or Linux
Install the Unity components for:
- Mobile development (iPhone / Android based on what you have)
- Unity Documentation
- Unity Standard Assets
- Support Mac, Windows (Linux - only if you use it)

## To Check After Installation
- Check that it installed Visual Studio 2017 (Mac or Windows)
- If you're using Linux, then you can use MonoDevelop (supplied by Unity) or Visual Studio Code
- Install the SDKs for your mobile if you haven't already

NOTE: Android development is usually easier as iPhone requires a Mac to build an application.
