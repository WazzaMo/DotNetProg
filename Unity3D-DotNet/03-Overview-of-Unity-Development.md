# Overview of Unity Development

# Entity Component Architecture
Unity implements a form of Entity-Component Architecture (also known as Entity-Component System)
that models things in the game world as entities and the behaviours and capabilities
as components.

Unity provides a lot of standard components to achieve basic and very re-usable things
like a Camera.

It is very common that you will need to define your own components to achieve
the behaviours, inputs and interactions that you need for your project.

# Organisation of These Notes
See the CSharp directory for notes on the CSharp language.
Some of these are more in-depth than you might need to make
basic components for Unity but they cover the basic language features
and it is likely that as the problem space of the projects evolves, more
of the C# language features will be useful.

# Contined Work in Progress
As unit MDC5215 is taught at Monash Arts Design and Architecture, this
set of notes will likely be extended.

Further Unity continues to evolve.  At the initial time of this writing
Unity had released 2017.1 and 2017.2 was in Beta.

# Functioning Components
See the companion GitHub repo WazzaMo/UnityComponents for functioning
examples.
