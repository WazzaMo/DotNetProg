# Unity 3D and .NET
Unity 3D is a Game Engine that was developed in 2004 and published as a product
that other developers could use in 2005.

Since mid-2000's Unity has used Mono, an open source .NET implementation, as the
basis for custom scripting.  This has been coupled to the Unity engine deeply and
it has been hard for Unity to update the version of .NET APIs they could support.
As of recent years, Unity has joined the .NET Foundation and in the latest version of Unity, 2017.1
you can now choose which version of .NET you need - Mono 2 (approx .NET 3.5), or more recent .NET 4.5.
The support for this choice is currently considered experimental but it's a great sign.

The Personal Edition is free for students and new, independent developers (indies) as long as
they make less than a certain amount annually from their Unity apps.  See the Unity Terms of Use for clarity on this.
