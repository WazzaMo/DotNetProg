# Versions and Installation

## DotNetCore Version Versus .NET Standard
So there are two different versions regarding .NET.  The version of the
CIL execution runtime and SDK (DotNetCore, .NET Framework, Xamarin or Mono)
and the version of the Standard of the .NET APIs that is supported.

Sometime back, Microsoft started the .NET Foundation who then became responsible
for facilitating the ongoing ratification of .NET and there are Standards that
say how big and how rich the API and class libraries are in the environment that
supports them.

We're not going to discuss .NET Standard anymore but remember that if you see
this it is referring to the size of the APIs supported.  .NET Standard 2.0 is a lot
larger than .NET Standard 1.2 and gives more capabilities.

See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard

## Installation

So different versions of DotNetCore can be installed and uninstalled
on the same machine, unlike .NET Framework.

## Open Source
A lot of DotNet and DotNetCore is actively developed on GitHub.
Even the CSharp language reference is developed on GitHub.

See the draft language reference projects:
